You and the dealer will always start off with 2 random cards in your deck, where your first card will always be hidden to your opponent(same goes for dealer).\n2. You must either draw a card, or pass - If you choose to draw a card, you will be given a random card from 1 to 11 that will be added to your deck. If you pass, you will skip to the dealers turn.\n3. The goal of the game is to draw cards until you get a sum up to 21 - However, going above this limit limits your turn to a pass and a win for the dealer, and vice versa.\n4. If both parties pass, then this result in a showdown, where the 'judge' compares the total points of both decks, and the player closest to 21 is the winner!\n5. However, it should be noted that if you get the same points as the dealer, this will not result in a draw, rather a loss for you.\n6.

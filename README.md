# Blackjack Game

A Python-based blackjack game (heavily inspired by Resident Evil 7, 21 DLC). This project was built with the goal of following the procedural programming paradigm that I ~~am studying~~ have studied at university.
Install with 'pip install 21blackjack-gui' and enter the command 'blackjack' in a terminal to run the game.

## Features
- Functional blackjack game: Where the first to win 3 rounds is the winner.
- Trump cards: Use special cards to help you gain an advantage over your opponent, for instance being able to set the card limit from 21 to 17.
- Player Profiles: Tracks games played, wins and losses for each unique user profile.
- Logic-based Dealer: Play against an intelligent but realistic opponent with its own ability to use trump cards, and knows when to stay or draw a card.
